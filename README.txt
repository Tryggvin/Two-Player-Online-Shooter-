HOW IT WORKS
1. server.py needs to run on skel.ru.is, it has a port 4050
2. run Control3DProgram.py
3a. if you want to test the game by yourself input 'y' when prompted
3b. if you have a server executed on skel.ru.is input 'n' when prompted (now 2 players can join the same server!)
4. enjoy!

setup
1. in a terminal windo execute this command using your skel account and password:
    "scp ./server.py <'username'>@skel.ru.is:<'path'>"
2. login to your skel
3. execute 'server.py'
4. run Control3DProgram.py
5. input 'n' when prompted.
6. wait for another player to join
7. enjoy a "BRUTAL" deathmatch.
